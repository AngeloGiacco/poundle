ðŸ’µOundle's local cryptocurrency to boost spending in local shops

Poundle is a new cryptocurrency modelled on the Bristol Pound. 
Each Poundle is worth Â£1.
Anybody can create a Poundle wallet and deposit funds in it.
However to receive funds (i.e: be paid for goods) they must be a local shop.
Only the local mayor can authorise a company's ability to receive payments. 
By forcing people to spend their Poundles in Oundle's local shops, we can take back control of our highstreet.
Funds will be spent in the local community and remain there instead of being funneled out to offshore bank accounts.
In addition, by logging all payments using Poundle's, mayors and councillors can leverage the power of real time feedback on the strength of the economy.

This is a project that will take a long time, face a lot of issues, most likely will never be finished. However, if it is possible to create this in Oundle and spread it across the UK it would be great for the strength of our economy.
