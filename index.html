                    <h1>Poundle</h1>
                    <p>Poundle is being developed by Angelo Giacco as a local
                       crytocurrency for Oundle. Each Poundle is worth exactly
                       Â£1. It will bring many benefits to our town. The main reason
                       for creating Poundle is to help local businesses. Poundles
                       can be purchased or exchanged for Pound sterling by anyone,
                       however they can only be traded for goods in local shops.
                       This incentivises buying from local businesses rather than
                       national behemoths like Waitrose. There are many others benefits
                       of this system that I will explain in a bit. Right now I'm
                       looking for help getting off the ground in these areas:
                       (help is unfortunately unpaid as Poundle is not-for-profit)</p>
                    <ul>

                            <h3>Developers</h3>
                            <p>Looking for help to create a blockchain
                               and digital wallet applicatoin for Poundle</p>
                        </li>

                            <p>I'm also looking for help liaising with the town
                               mayor to get this cryptocurrency accepted by the
                               council and adopted by local businesses.
                               Also must look in to GDPR compliance.</p>

                    <h2>Help the council!</h2>
                    <p>Payments made with Poundle can be monitored to see how
                       the local economy is performing. The council can not see
                       who you are and what you are buying but will receive useful
                       information on the number and volume of transactions made on
                       a day. This will greatly help them to measure how efficient
                       certain incentives are and to see when new incentives are
                       required to stimulate the local economy.

                    <p>Poundles can only be spent in local businesses, thus
                       boosting the local economy. Anybody that distrusts large
                       organisations that shuttle their profits into offshore accounts
                       and believes in the importance of the local highstreet
                       should use Poundles to support their local businesses!</p>

                    <h2>Save the planet!</h2>
                    <p>By supporting local businesses, you are not only boosting
                       our town's economy you are also saving the planet. The
                       logistics operations used by companies like Waitrose and Tesco
                       are extremely polluting and damaging to the environment.
                       By spending your poundles in local shops that source their
                       goods locally, you are contributing greatly to reducing carbon
                       emissions and saving our planet!</p>
